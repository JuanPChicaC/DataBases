# Databases
This repository contains all the storage solutions required to support projects and implementations explained in other repositories. The main idea, is to show all the capabilities related with SQL and NoSQL databases like ETLs, store procedures etc... to be replicable by any user. Finally, it is important to say that in some cases  pure SQL or NoSQl are not used, it can be find that other frameworks will be used to create, update or just to read information from databases.
